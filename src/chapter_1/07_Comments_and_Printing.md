# Comments and Printing

## Comments

In Helios comments are declared using two forward slashes (`//`).

```rust, noplaypen
// This is a comment.
```

## Printing

For debugging purposes Helios has a `print` function.

```rust
print("Imagine something cool.")
```

> **Note:** Printing is **horrible** for production code as they lead to bloated validators.
