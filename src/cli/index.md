# Helios CLI

This chapter explains how to use the [*helios-cli*](https://github.com/Hyperion-BT/helios-cli), and how to build and submit transactions using *cardano-cli*.

> **Note**: *helios-cli* is work-in-progress and can only be used for simple operations (compiling, evaluating parameters, calculating script addresses).
